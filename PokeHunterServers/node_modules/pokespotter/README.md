# Pokespotter - Node.js library for finding Pokemon in Pokemon GO

This module allows you to easily determine the Pokemon that are around a certain location. It uses the [Node.js wrapper for the Pokemon GO API](https://github.com/Armax/Pokemon-GO-node-api).

# Installation

## 3. Require and initialize module

```js

```

# Example using Google

```js
var Pokespotter = require('pokespotter')('username@gmail.com', 'mypassword', 'google');
